Executive Summary1.1. Decisions to be impactedBased on our research, anomaly detection algorithms play a crucial role in shaping business decisions across three key areas:¡ñ Personal Savings Protection: By identifying abnormal transactions, banks and other financial institutions can proactively monitor and block suspicious or high-risk activities, thereby safeguarding individual savings and account security.¡ñ Risk Management: Anomaly detection enables financial institutions to recognize unusual patterns within portfolio management, allowing for timely adjustments to investment strategies, and ultimately enhancing risk management and financial performance.¡ñ Anti-Money Laundering (AML): A major application of anomaly detection is in identifying irregular transaction behaviors that may indicate potential money laundering activities, helping institutions comply with regulations and prevent financial crime.1.2.
